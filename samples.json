We find that the solar-like spectral lines, \u03b3 Doradus and \u03b3 Doradus-\u03b4 Scuti lines, are strongly enhanced by the interaction of the stellar wind with the accretion disc. The strength of the wind is determined by the mass loss rate from the source, the distance of the ionizing source and the shape of the spectral lines. Our results can be used to constrain the distance of the source from the source and the shape of the spectral lines observed. We analyze the correlation between the strength of the wind and the shape of the spectral lines in the presence of the stellar wind. We find that the strong correlation between the strength of the wind and the shape of the spectral lines provides an independent constraint on the wavelength-dependent shape of the stellar wind, which is not possible when the spectral lines are found with the Hubble Space Telescope.

We confirm previous claims that the transit depth is not a single constant and that the transit depth can vary significantly with the transit duration. We also observe departures from a linear relation in the transit duration due to stellar limb darkening. However, the effects of stellar limb darkening are not directly observable because the limb darkening is not included in the transit duration correction. We find that the full transit duration can vary between 0.01 and 0.7-0.4 times as the radius.

The results show that the theoretical predictions are not adequate to account for the observed transit-like features. In particular, the photometric data are not sufficient for a fitting of the theoretical transit model. This is a consequence of the fact that the models predicted by the models with the densest core do not fulfil the observed transit-like features, even when the models with the thin radius do not have the same error bars. The main limitation of the models is the mass loss. We show that the models with the thin radius predict the best results for the planetary mass-radius and radius-envelope structure.\nWe study how the heating efficiency of convective boundary layers affects the radiative transfer in a fluid system with two segments: a hot one in the middle and an icy one at the base. The radiative transfer is done for a fluid body in a two-dimensional plane. We apply the same treatment to the case of a planetary system with two ice rings. In a three-dimensional fluid system, the radiative transfer is done for both the hot ice ring and the icy one. We show that the hot ice ring radiates more away from the observing location than the icy one. The intensity of the radiative transfer depends on the thickness of the icy ring. The size of the hot ice ring depends on the radius of the icy ring.

The results of this work confirm the results of an earlier study in which a linear bispectrum analysis was used to analyze the light curve of the transiting planet.

We quantify the problems of the formation of mini-Neptunes and super-Earths in such a system and compare our results to those of previous models. We then consider the properties of gas giant planets in a more general gravitational microphysical model, which includes planet migration and the formation of gas giants. We find that some gas giants migrate through the disk as a result of radial migration induced by the disk wind. In other cases, super-Earths may form near their host stars. We find that gas giants often form inside their host stars. We further compare our results to the results of a model which includes migration and disk wind evolution, and find that migration produces a planet mass that is close to that of the original super-Earth, whereas disk wind produces a planet mass that is much larger than what is required to form a super-Earth in the disk.\nIn a recent paper, Gao et al. proposed a new method to infer the planetary mass and radius from spectra of transiting exoplanets.

We show that the planetary orbits are nearly circular for the expected configuration of the system, but significantly eccentricity increases with orbital distance. The minimum eccentricity can be as high as \u223c0.8 for close-in planets and as high as \u223c0.5 for wide-in planets. Such orbits are expected to be unstable if the planet is not close to the star. We also investigate the orbital evolution of planets in the habitable zone of the host star. We find that planets in the habitable zone do not evolve their orbits by much, if at all, with orbital distance. This is because the tidal circularization time-scale for the planet is much shorter than the orbital evolution time-scale of the planet. This is sufficient time for the planet to have a large eccentricity before tidal circularization takes place. We provide analytical forms for the orbital evolution times for planets in the habitable zone of the host star as a function of stellar masses and planet eccentricity. We then compare our results to the predictions of dynamical simulations.

We find that the detection range is narrow (above about 0.03 M\u2609), but is not necessarily assured by the high flux ratios that are usually required for detection. The detection range is also not always assured by the small variations of the stellar surface temperature (above about 0.01 K).

We apply this framework to both the Kepler Transiting Exoplanet Survey (TESS) and the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) to determine which exoplanets can be well-constrained with the statistical framework. The statistical framework, which is based on the hypothesis that the system is dynamically stable, aligns the parameter space for the planetary obliquity with the orbital period, and accounts for the planet's orbital eccentricity.

Water vapor absorption reaches a maximum limit near 17 \u03bcm, and the amount of water vapor in the atmosphere is limited by the absorption of other molecules. The spectral features of water vapor absorption are characterized by a spectral index of 1.49 \u00b1 0.06, which is higher than the value of 0.16 \u00b1 0.05 found in previous works. We find that the bulk of water vapor absorption is not observed in the spectrum of the Sun because the spectral energy distribution (SED) of water vapor absorption is too broad.

The temporal evolution of the pulsation pattern is well constrained by the presence of low-degree, low-spectral-index modes, but not by the presence of short-term, and hence low-spectral-index-dotted pulsations. These low-spectral-index modes, which have been identified as being superimposed on the higher-order pulsation frequencies, are probably related to the low-degree modes of the low-spectral-index pulsar PSR J0992-4743.

Although this relationship is well established, the radius and orbital period vary significantly with the properties of the host star. For close-in planets, the radius is typically 6.0-4.2 R_Jup and is generally expressed as a power-law of log(R/R_J) = -0.43 \u00b1 0.10.

The collision model allows for both the planetesimal to be dynamically unsteady, and the mass of planetesimal to be dynamically determined by planetesimal-host planetesimal-planetesimal interactions. We find that the mass of the planetesimal depends on the mass distribution of the planets, and that planetesimals with smaller mass must have a higher mass than the mass distribution of the largest planetesimals in the system. The 3:1 mean-motion resonance between the planetesimal and planetesimal leads to elastic interactions between the two bodies and also to the migration of planetesimals from the inner disk out to the wide orbit.\nWe present an analysis of the microlensing event OGLE-2015-BLG-0960.

We have identified two new planetary candidates, namely, the super-Earth GJ 1214b and the sub-Neptune GJ 436b. We confirm the planetary nature of both potential transiting objects and measure a slightly larger radius for GJ 1214b than for GJ 436b. We also present a new candidate, GJ 436b, for which we find a higher radius than that of Kepler-17b, the sub-Neptune with the highest density measured in this study. These two objects, and Kepler-17b and Kepler-18b, form a new class of planetary candidates which have higher densities and shorter orbital periods.\nWe report the discovery of two new transiting hot Jupiters discovered from the WASP survey: WASP-1b, a 0.9 MJ planet in an 8.6 yr orbit around a bright (V = 11), fainter star, and WASP-2b, a 0.3 MJ planet in a 1.1 yr orbit around a brighter, \u223c20 mag fainter star.

The light curve is well fit with a single power spectrum with the central peak indicating the planet-to-star flux ratio of \u223c0.20. The planet-to-star flux ratio in the pixel-1 region is consistent with the transit light curve and is not significantly different from the values in the two other regions. The data are sparse, meaning that our knowledge of the planet's true mass is not very well constrained. The best-fit model has a mass of 0.84 \u00b1 0.07 MJup and is on a retrograde orbit with a semi-major axis of 6.2 AU. The planet-to-star radius ratio is within error bars. This result is a surprise, as the planet-to-star radius ratio is expected to be very high for a planet in a retrograde orbit. We also find that the mass and period of the planet are different from the mass and period expected from the mass and period of a planet in a circular orbit. The asymmetry is probably due to the presence of a massive planet in a close orbit. The planet and stellar mass, which have a ratio of 0.25, are incompatible with the mass and period expected from a circular orbit.\nThe Kepler mission of the Kepler Space Telescope has been a valuable tool for the study of extrasolar planetary systems. However, the precise composition of planets detected by the mission is still very much an enigma.

We use HARPS measurements of the radial velocities to constrain the masses and temperatures of the four transiting planets. We find that the planets are mostly 9.8 M\u2295, 9.5 M\u2295, and 13, 5 and 12 M\u2295, respectively, and we estimate that they are mostly 6 M\u2295, 4 M\u2295, and 0.6 M\u2295. The planetary radii are 1.32 R\u2295, 2.50 R\u2295, and 2.34 R\u2295, respectively. This implies that the planets are mostly rocky. The measured transit times are consistent with a constant period. From a dynamical point of view, the planets are extremely close to each other, but the system is highly eccentric. The eccentricity is probably the result of tides raised on the planet by the central star. The system is also highly inclined relative to the sky plane. The system is also strongly asymmetric, with the sky plane being slightly inclined and the planets aligned to the sky plane. This makes the system a valuable target for studying systems at cross sections and for the study of orbital evolution in systems with multiple planets.\nWe present a detailed study of the transit timing variations (TTVs) of the WASP-4b exoplanet based on 18 months of HARPS (High Resolution Echelle Spectrometer for Spitzer) observations, spanning the duration of the transit. We find that the stellar radial velocity (RV) variations show no evidence of periodic TTVs, confirming the previous finding that the planet is in a first-order resonance with the host star.

The spectral features of the various isotopic species are compared, and the relationship between the spectroscopic surface of a planet and its spectroscopic surface is discussed. The results show that the binding energies of CO and CO2 are strongly affected by the evolutionary stage of an exoplanet. Although a strong negative correlation between the binding energies and the mass-radius relationship is observed for planets in the mass range 1.5-4.5 M\u2295, this effect is more pronounced for planets in the mass range 33-49 M\u2295. The binding energies of CO and CO2 are strongly correlated with the surface temperature for the central region of the planet. The surface temperature of the planet is also found to be strongly correlated with the mass-radius relationship. The temperature of the planet is found to be correlated with the light-travel time of the exoplanets. The correlation between the mass-radius relationship and the mass-pressure relationship, which are the two main constants governing the mass-radius relationship, are shown to be spurious.\nWe investigate the tidal evolution of close-in extrasolar giant planets.

We find that the probability of detecting planets with radii between 0.1 and 1.0RJ is extremely low, and a full analysis of the full sample is needed to assess the true rate of occurrence. To estimate the true number of planets, we use the planet occurrence rate as a function of stellar mass and distance, and the current detection efficiency of the GPI survey. We find that the GPI survey is detecting planets with radii between 0.01 and 1.0RJ at probability greater than 0.01%, and mass ratios greater than 0.01%. This high detection efficiency suggests that the number of planets at 0.01-1.0RJ is not representative of the true occurrence of planets in the GPI survey.\nThe Steering Committee on the Gas-Gaseous Moon Transit Survey (GTCS) issued this announcement in 2011 January:\nWe report a new detection of a secondary eclipse of the hot-Neptune GJ436b, which was previously found to be the primary component in a binary system with a separation of about 860 AU. The eclipse was found during a transit of the planet with an orbital period of 4.5 days, duration of the transit of 2.82 hr, and an inclination of the planet with respect to the line of sight of about 43\u00b0. The eclipse depth is 0.050% \u00b1 0.025% (3.5\u03c3 confidence level), and the orbital inclination is about 84\u00b0 \u00b1 4\u00b0.

The large spectral resolving power of a high-resolution spectrum gives a unique insight into the chemical compositions and cloud structures in its atmosphere. We obtained spectra of three transiting exoplanets with different ages, and annotated their spectral features. We then used these data to determine the primary and secondary emission spectra for the three exoplanets. We also compare the spectra of the three planets to synthetic spectra of a grid of synthetic spectra in the wavelength region between 0.55 and 0.76 \u03bcm. We find that the primary emission spectrum varies with the decreasing temperature of the exoplanet atmosphere. We also find that the secondary emission spectrum varies with the decreasing frequency of the planet\u2019s half-height. These variations in the secondary emission spectrum can be well approximated by the combination of the planet\u2019s orbital phase and the spectra of the three planets. Finally, we find that the stellar activity induced by the host star controls the secondary eclipse of the planet. We thereby conclude that the secondary eclipse of the planet is an independent indicator of the presence of an atmosphere.\nThe spectrophotometric properties of exoplanets have greatly improved since the last time such measurements were available.

Aims: We aim to study the effect of stellar magnetic fields on the orbits of planets orbiting in the habitable zone of low-mass stars, in order to interpret the properties of this zone. Methods: We used a sample of low-mass stars with planets known to host a primary dynamo (that is, a non-negligible source of heating) and a secondary dynamo (that is, an inertial component). The magnetic field geometry and strength of the primary dynamo were derived from 3D radiation-hydrodynamic simulations. We then compared the properties of the secondary dynamo to those of the primary dynamo in a self-consistent manner. Results: We find that the secondary dynamo can generate more than the primary dynamo for a given planetary orbit, depending on the stellar mass, effective temperature, and the tidal heating efficiency. Therefore, we conclude that the main source of heat for a planet orbiting around a low-mass star lies with the secondary dynamo, and that this heat source is not necessarily distributed evenly between the primary and secondary dynamo components. We also find that planets orbiting low-mass stars are unlikely to be tidally disrupted due to their proximity to the star. Conclusions: The results suggest that the habitable zone around low-mass stars is not always closed to interaction with the stellar magnetosphere, but that it may be open to interaction with the stellar wind for some planets.\nAims: The discovery of exoplanets is supposed to be a new science that can only be performed with the use of the precision time-domain spectroscopy (TDS) provided by the CoRoT satellite.

We fit the two planets as two-body systems, each with one inner planet on a circular orbit and one orbit slightly larger than the other. We then use the K2 light curve to obtain the projected rotational velocities of the two planets.

When a planet approaches in front of a star, it can attract up to about 20 Earth mass in gas and up to about 5 Earth mass in solids. This attracts gas from the surrounding region and then repels gas from the surrounding region. Most of the gas in the disk is driven by the planet, while the remaining gas is dragged by solids. The disk is thus seen as a quilt. If the planet approaches behind the star, the disk spins up and the planet can become trapped in the disk. In this case the planet can become trapped in the disk for a time of about 10 Earth years, which is longer than the disk lifetime. The planet can obtain a very large amount of gas from the disk as a result of this process.\nWe present results from a Spitzer survey of protoplanetary disks around young stars. The observations are sensitive enough to detect dust emission at millimeter wavelengths at 8 and 24 \u03bcm and to detect gas emission at 1.3 mm and at 1.2 mm and 2.5 \u03bcm. The targets of the survey are young stars with accretion rates of &gt;about 1 Myr yr-1. The gas emission detected at 1.3 mm is consistent with that seen at 12 and 16 \u03bcm.

The detection of gas emission indicates that the gas in the disk has a very small temperature. At 24 \u03bcm, gas emission is detected at a lower level than dust emission. This suggests that dust emission at this wavelength is almost entirely due to gas emission. The total gas emission detected at 8 and 24 \u03bcm is interpreted as the result of dust and gas accretion in the same disk.\nSelf-consistent spectral synthesis modeling of the gas and dust emissions from SNe Ia and II Peg has been performed.

The first three planets were detected in the habitable zone of a star: KIC 3715763, KIC 6907959, and KIC 10594706. The habitable zone extends to the entire stellar disk (R \u223c 70 AU) and includes the entire stellar wind at the planet's location. The stellar wind is not required to be constant around each star. It is possible that the stellar wind has undergone significant evolution in the past (e.g., the wind mass lost by solar-type stars has been estimated to be about 10-2 Msolar yr-1). The evolution of the stellar wind, in turn, may influence the properties of planets, including the habitability of planets. Here, we explore possible interactions between the stellar wind, the planet, and the host star to determine whether planets in the habitable zone can be considered \"Earth analogues.\" We find that if the stellar wind is relatively weak (&lt;10-4 Msolar yr-1), then the habitability of any planet in the habitable zone is not substantially affected. If the stellar wind is strong (&gt;about 10-1 Msolar yr-1), however, the habitability of a planet is significantly affected. We also find that if the stellar wind is strongly magnetized (&gt;about 10-2 Msolar yr-1), then the planet must be relatively close (R &lt; 10 AU) to the star to be habitable.

Standard models of disk evolution predict that planetary systems evolve by a combination of disk fragmentation and planetesimal accretion, and that the majority of these collisions result in the evolution of planetary systems by a combination of planetesimal accretion and disk fragmentation. However, it is unclear whether the mechanism of planetesimal accretion can operate in systems where planetesimals are scarce and have a high rate of collision with each other. We reexamine this issue by performing numerical simulations of the evolution of a disk with a low-mass planetesimal disk in a protoplanetary disk. In this case, the disk fragmentation process is efficient and leads to the evolution of the planetesimal distribution in a single collision, and the growth of planetesimal embryos by collisional fragmentation. We find that a planetesimal swarm can grow to considerably larger sizes than the initial disk lifetime. In contrast, the disk fragmentation phase is short, and the cumulative disk evolution has a rather low rate of growth. Our results suggest that if there exists a region of stability in a protoplanetary disk where planetesimals can grow to large sizes after the fragmentation process, this region may be responsible for the formation of planets in the inner disk.\nDuring the protostellar stage, the gas accreting onto the central star can grow by accreting solids from a protoplanetary disk.

This effect may be crucial in determining the subsequent evolution of the disc during the final stages of the protostellar disc evolution. The efficiency of this process is determined by the length of the accretion disc lifetime. We also consider the effect of disk winds on the disk structure and wind mass-loss rates. In the case of the YSOs, we find that the CO/N2 envelope fraction is not always sufficient for the accretion of the mass and escape of the planet to the parent star as observed for more massive discs. This is due to the fact that the envelope fraction is determined by the gas accretion rate. We also find that the accretion rates due to the wind can be very high, and that the rate of mass-loss due to the wind is quite sensitive to the individual accretion properties. We conclude that the accretion disc of YSOs cannot be described by the simple model of a single massive disc with a thick outer disc and a thin inner gap.\nWe have carried out a detailed study of the evolution of the dust population in the protostellar disc of the T Tauri star (TTS) BD+20 000. We have derived the evolution of the dust mass-loss rates, with the method of Lorenz-Mie theory. We derived the disc mass-loss rates by fitting the evolution model to the observed optical/IR spectral energy distribution using a simple prescription for the expansion and contraction of the disc. We also studied the population properties of the dust population by constructing the evolution model and assigning it to the observational data. Our analysis shows that the disc has an"}, {"Input": "The origin and evolution of planetary systems", "Output": "The origin and evolution of planetary systems is one of the main goals of astrobiology. In this paper, we present the first detailed analysis of the interactions between a protostar and a planetary system, using numerical simulations. We focus on the protostar interaction, which may lead to the formation of dust grains in the disk of a protostar. We show that the protostar's interaction with the disk is crucial for the development of the dust distribution in the disk. For a protostar of radius R*=1.5 million km, we find a typical radius of 1.38 planetary radii (R\u2295) and a dust formation rate of 0.12 grains per second (gaseous pellets) per primary star. For a protostar with a radius of 1.5 million km and a mass of 1.5 M\u2295, we find a typical radius of 1.71 R\u2295 and a dust formation rate of 0.22 grains per second (gaseous pellets) per primary star. The dust formation rate enables us to study the evolution of the dust disk in a planetary system, by comparing the calculated density profile with the observed one. We find that the disk of a protostar with a mass similar to the mass of Jupiter does not match the one that is observed with Hubble Space Telescope (HST) or Spitzer Space Telescope (ESO) or ground-based (Holland et al. and T.

We instead suggest that the protostar's interaction with the disk is responsible for the observed pattern. In addition, we find that the gas-rich disk of the protostar is depleted in dust particles at the inner edge of the disk of the binary system, in striking contrast with the gas-rich disks of the disk of the protostar.

This discovery was announced in early 2010. The 1.3-D shape of the transit was determined from spectroscopy and the orbital period from an extraction of short-cadence light curves. The mass, period and radius of CoRoT-7b are M = 1.041-0.035+0.037 and R = 0.814-0.029+0.035 R_J, respectively, and the transit epoch is Tc = 2453893.55753 \u00b1 0.00067 (BJD). The Natur team immediately released all the light curves and the complete transit light curves, which were followed up with additional observations by other observers. From the complete data set, we find that the planet is in a 2.86072-0.000029 day orbit around the G4V star, with a mass of M = 0.078-0.0025+0.0026 M_J and a period of P = 3.175-0.0021+0.0028 days. The planet is transiting with an orbital inclination of i = 86.\u00b006 \u00b1 0.\u00b007. The high inclination results from the planet's proximity to an M-dwarf host, which enhances the planet's radius.

This method is based on the integration of Keplerian orbits in the time-space where the masses of the planets are determined by integrating the orbital solutions from the Keplerian orbits of the planets. The orbital solutions are obtained using a general method in which the integration time-scale is set by the relative mass ratio m between the masses of a planet and its host star. The method is tested on two different sets of planet radii and masses: a static, solar orbit and an eccentric orbit. We find that the two sets of orbits are almost identical. The eccentricity exhibited by the solar system rings results from the eccentricity of Jupiter and Venus, and varies with the eccentricity of the disk planet around the Sun. The eccentricity of the disk planet around Jupiter is more numerous than that exhibited by the rings. The solar system rings exhibit a strong negative correlation between their eccentricities and the mass ratio m between the ring and planet masses. The masses of the rings differ significantly from that of the planetary system and the disk planet around the Sun. The masses of the rings and disks are correlated with each other and with each other.

MARVELS targets, mainly from Kepler, were observed in the northern hemisphere with the APOGEE spectrograph on the Magellan/MIKE spectrograph, while our observations were carried out at the Spitzer Space Telescope. We report the discovery of eight new exoplanets, including three multi-planet systems, five multi-planet systems with multiple transiting planets, and one multi-planet system with only one transiting planet. We also report the first detection of a second companion to the primary star in the multi-planet system. We find that each of the eight systems has a slightly eccentric orbit, but the masses of the planets in all of them are consistent with Neptune-like masses. We determine the internal structure of the exoplanets with a detailed analysis of the radial velocity curves, and find that they are consistent with being in the mass range 0.1 M\u2295-1.5 M\u2295. Combining the high precision of the radial velocity measurements with the high precision of the transit light curve, we find that our measurements of the mass, radius, and density of the exoplanets match well with the transit observations. The high precision of the observations allows us to determine the planetary radii with much lower uncertainty than that obtained previously by others.

We have carried out extensive radial velocity (RV) follow-up of the K2-122 system with the HARPS and HIRES spectrographs, which allowed us to obtain precise transit and occultation measurements.

We use data from the HARPS, CORALIE, and HIRES radial velocity spectrometers to measure the velocity, v sini, and acceleration, \u03b1, of the stellar oscillations. The activities of the stars can be separated into two main groups: one is typical for typical active dwarf stars, and the other is a group of very active stars. We find that the velocity, v sini, and \u03b1 of the stars in the typical active dwarf group are different from those of the more active stars, although the smaller sample size and slightly lower v sini of the stars in the very active group correspond to larger systematic errors. We also find that the much smaller sample size of the HARPS data leads to an average smaller error estimate \u03b1 than in the previous works.\nIn the post-EROS era, the term \"exotransit\" has been used to refer to the transit of stellar rotation period that is simultaneously being interpreted as a sign of an extra-solar planet (exo-Earth) being present in that system.

The companion is detected in both the H\u03b1 (3.6 \u03bcm) and the Ks (4.5 \u03bcm) bands and is consistent with being completely eclipsed by the host star. This is the first time that an eclipsing hot Jupiter has been found in the mid-infrared. WASP-12b is one of only a handful of hot Jupiters discovered to date in the optical and we expect that the planet's mid-infrared spectrum is dominated by absorption by photospheric clouds.\nWe present a comprehensive transit light curve for the WASP-12b exoplanetary system obtained with the InfraRed Array Camera (IRAC) on the Spitzer Space Telescope using the two 1.0-m telescopes. We observed five transits and three secondary eclipses of the planet, with a median precision of 0.005 mmag (3\u03c3 accuracy) and 0.026 mmag (2\u03c3 accuracy).

A careful analysis of the available radial velocity data leads us to conclude that the two planets are orbiting with periods of about 3.1 and 10.6 days. The planet's minimum mass is found to be 0.41 \u00b1 0.09 MJup, and its semimajor axis is estimated to be 0.098 \u00b1 0.010 AU.

We also study the effects of a hot Jupiter on its exosphere, and investigate the effect of cloud formation, which may occur in Kepler-4b's atmosphere. We find that, although the planet radii are larger than theoretical expectations, the length of the exosphere depends on the planetary radius. The length scales as a function of the planetary radius are small compared to the length scales of the stellar wind and stellar wind. The shape of the exosphere is determined by the planetary radius. The length scale of the stellar wind is also an important factor.

The resulting minimum mass for the second system is 0.03 M\u2609. The primary component, with a period of 5.3 ms, is a mid-M-dwarf. We find a second period in the J-band light curve, which we attribute to the rotational modulation of a third body in this system. The minimum mass for the third body is 0.14 M\u2609. The properties of this system suggest that the star is a mid-M-dwarf that hosts a planet orbiting in a highly eccentric orbit. The star also exhibits a period in the J-band light curve that is modulated by the orbital motion of the planet, consistent with the presence of a third body in the system. We analyse the available photometric data and constrain the orbital parameter of the third body using the principle of least-squares fitting. We find that the third body in the system does not perturb the light curve significantly and that the planet is unlikely to be causing the other light variations. The absence of light variations in the secondary and the third body, both of which are highly eccentric, suggests that the planet is at least as large as Neptune.Based on observations made with the HARPS instrument on the ESO 3.6 m telescope under the program IDs 072.C-0488, 075.C-0142, and 077.C-0833.The light curves and radial velocity curves are only available at the CDS via anonymous ftp to <A href"}, {"Input": "Observations of GJ 1214 b suggest cloud are present", "Output": "Observations of GJ 1214 b suggest cloud are present there.

We examined the radial velocity time-series of these targets, and we determined their orbital parameters. We found that the distribution of orbital parameters is not well matched by a linear fit, which points to the need of a second mode to explain the observed orbits of the exoplanet systems. We investigated the influence of a second mode to explain the observed orbits of some exoplanets.

Our RVs for 2MASS J22154577-0005015 and 2MASS J2311374-000409 show a significant RV precision that allows us to place 8-year precision limits on both stars. We derive a new orbital period of 28.30 \u00b1 0.15 days for 2MASS J22154577-0005015, which is consistent with previous high-precision RV measurements. We also find that its RV amplitude is consistent with that of a normal M dwarf. We speculate that this signal could be due to an exoplanetary system. We use our high-precision RVs to investigate the existence of a short-period stellar companion to 2MASS J22154577-0005015. We find that the stellar companion is a 1.6 \u00b1 0.2 M_Jup planet with a minimum mass of 0.45 \u00b1 0.10MJup and a period of 23.7 \u00b1 0.06 days.

During the last few decades, the number of planets that have been detected around Sun-like stars has become large enough that the method of detection has become feasible to test, and to determine if it can be used as a useful tool. We use the results of our work to provide guidance to the search for correlations among the different aspects of the accretion process, such as the mass-loss rate, the disk radius, the planet mass, the ejection mechanism, and the stellar mass. We also consider the effects of stellar irradiation. Since the mass-loss rate is the most important parameter for planet radial migration, we use disk models to estimate the model for the radial mixing of material that is accreted onto the planet during its evolution. We find that, when the accretion rate is determined from the observed mass-loss rate, a strong correlation exists between the disk radius and the mass-loss rate. We discuss possible observational implications of such a correlation.\nA new disk model is described for planet growth and escape from the habitable zone around M stars. The disk model assumes that the initial gas disk is eccentric and is initially truncated by a planet moving on a fixed orbit. It is shown that a 3-dimensional (3D) hydrodynamical disk with constant mass and temperature is necessary to explain the disk observations of escape and growth. The disk model is then applied to the two most common examples of exoplanet escape: hot Jupiters escaping from the habitable zone of M stars and brown dwarf escape from the habitable zone of G and K dwarfs. We use our model to assess the likelihood of the three escape scenarios to be consistent with the observed mass-loss rates. We then use the disk model to test how well it can reproduce the observed escape rate and the mass-loss rate from M stars to G and K dwarfs.

We investigate the effect of a high ionizing radiation field (low-energy) in the ionosphere and explore the ionospheric scale of the ionosphere using the 2D hydrodynamical simulation Code ARCH4. The simulation is done for high X-ray and cosmic rays, and includes the effects of a 50 m (~1 kr) high-energy particle shower that occurs in the ionosphere during the planetary transit. The results from the simulation allow us to study the ionospheric scale of the ionosphere under the influence of the low-energy particle shower. We find that the ionospheric scale for the high-energy particle shower varies with time, as expected from the theory of ionospheric dynamics, and by a factor of 2 or more with respect to the solar wind plasma volume. We also find that the particle shower can lead to the formation of a pressure difference in the ionosphere that can be related to the ionosphere-to-stellar mass ratio.\nContext.

This view is based on the idea that the solar system formed from a single planetesimal disk that was dynamically disrupted by the presence of Jupiter (Jupiter). The dynamical disruption was caused by the planetesimal disk because of the perturbations of one or more other bodies, such as moons or rings. In the case of Saturn, this disruption was caused by Saturn's moon, Triton. According to this view, the moons are the remnants of the original planetesimal disk that was dynamically disrupted by Jupiter (Jupiter). Their orbits are located on dynamically excited, one-armed eccentric orbits in a gas disk. The moons have a semimajor axis of 6.5A, with an eccentricity of 0.35, and a period of three days. They are strongly coupled to the disk and can undergo significant orbital evolution. The moons are dynamically excited by Jupiter and can drive the disk away from the planet's orbit. This article presents the results of numerical integrations that show that, even in the case of an initially circular disk, the moons can undergo significant orbital evolution if their orbits are initially misaligned from the disk plane. The moons' orbits are excited through jovian leverage; for a given moon's eccentricity, its orbit can be excited up to the moon-planetesimal alignment distance if the moon's eccentricity is greater than or equal to the moon's orbital eccentricity. An eccentric moon's orbit can be excited to a significant degree only if the moon's orbital eccentricity is greater than or equal to the moon-planetesimal alignment distance. For moons to be dynamically stable, they must be dynamically coupled to the disk and the moon-planetesimal alignment distance. From the integrations, we determine the minimum moons' orbital eccentricity for a variety of moon-planetesimal alignments, including moons in Mars' orbit, those around Saturn, and those around Uranus and Neptune."}, {"Input": "Earth-like planets in the habitable zone of their host star are", "Output": "Earth-like planets in the habitable zone of their host star are discussed.

The light curves were obtained during the planetary orbital period of 19.15 \u00b1 0.25 d, which corresponds to the transit of the planet in its Roche lobe. The observed light curves are consistent with the transit corresponding to a planet with a radius of \u223c2.24 \u00b1 0.07 RJup and a mass of \u223c17.0 \u00b1 0.3 MJup. The planet has a density of \u223c2.78-0.53+0.61 g cm-3 and a circular orbit. The spherical harmonic expansion of the planet's orbit indicates a retrograde longitude of the ascending node = 21 \u00b1 3\u00b0.

The measured orbital inclination of the planet is consistent with a 32\u00b0 \u00b1 15\u00b0 inclination angle. From the mass and radius of the planet, we have also extracted a planetary mean density of \u223c0.55 \u00b1 0.12 g cm-3.

The dynamical instability of the stellar wind could then lead to the formation of planets through EMI.\nWe present an analysis of the photometric variability of three short-period transiting planet candidates observed by the Kepler Mission. We first present the results of an analysis of the Kepler light curves in which we observe several transits of the hot Neptune GJ 436b. We find that the transit times measured in this way are in good agreement with the transit timing inferred from the photometric variability of the GJ 436b dwarf HD 17156b and the brown dwarf Gliese 229Bb. We then use the transit duration as the fundamental quantity in our transit modeling. We obtain a constrained upper limit of 1.54\u00d710-9 M\u2295 on the mass of the planet and a lower limit of 1.10\u00d710-5 M\u2295 on the radius. We find that the planet radius and mass can be satisfied in a few places by models assuming either (1) a 2 M\u2295 or (2) a 0.1 M\u2295 core. We also find that HD 17156b would have been detected in the first two main transit channels by Kepler and that the 3rd channel may not be sufficient to resolve the ambiguity of the mass and radius constraints. The 3rd channel is better suited for resolving the uncertainties in the mass and radius. We conclude that the low-frequency transit timing is not a reliable way to constrain the physical properties of the GJ 436b planet. We also find that the transit of GJ 436b observed in the third channel shows significant systematic effects, whose nature we model as a mixture of (1) a periodic modulation of the transit times, (2"}, {"Input": "Earth-like planets in the habitable zone of their host star are", "Output": "Earth-like planets in the habitable zone of their host star are generally devoid of life, consistent with the well-established trend that planets with Earth-like conditions have higher concentrations of volatiles.

For this purpose, we use the results of three-dimensional hydrodynamics simulations of a magnetized Earth to investigate the evolution of magnetic fields on the planets of the solar system. We also compute the properties of the planetary magnetosphere and its potential to interact with the stellar wind. We find preliminary evidence for a correlation between the presence of a magnetic field on an exoplanet and the presence of a magnetic cycle. Finally, we calculate the radial distribution of the magnetic field strengths on each planet and discuss how these results can be used to constrain the formation of planets with a magnetic field.\nWe present a detailed analysis of transit light curves obtained by the TESS mission, which enabled us to search for a sensitivity to the presence of additional bodies in the system.

In the current paper, we examine the impact of the stellar wind from a magnetically active M-dwarf host on the planetary atmosphere and the planetary magnetosphere. By simulating a hypothetical close-in exoplanet orbiting in the habitable zone of a M-dwarf star with a similar mass and an Earth-like atmosphere and with a snowball-like magnetosphere, we find that the stellar wind can significantly modify the planetary orbit. For planets in the habitable zone, the stellar wind can cause a planetary transit in the form of a high-eccentricity orbit, a planet crossing the disc as it approaches the star, and an additional close-in planet orbiting in the disc as it approaches the star. Planetary encounters between planetary embryos of Earth and Mars are also possible. The main advantage of the present paper is that it analyzes the processes that take place in the planet's atmosphere, and provides a first estimate on the effect of the stellar wind on the atmosphere and the planetary magnetosphere.\nAims: The climate of the rapidly rotating, unsettled atmospheres of early solar-type stars can be affected by internal waves from the stars' surface convection zone and by external waves propagating from the interior. In particular, the expected dynamical effects of the internal waves can cause rapid radial mixing of the stellar wind and, therefore, the rotation rates of the stellar wind. For the hot stars, the expected dynamical effects are much less pronounced. <BR />Methods: We investigate the internal waves and the external waves in the atmospheres of three hydrogen-rich, rapidly rotating, hot-Jupiters with rotation periods of 3.5, 10, and 20 d.

We model the evolution of an Earth-like planet embedded in a protoplanetary disk and consider the effects of a potential planet receiving material from the disk. We consider two different cases in which the planet's orbit depends on the planet's orbital parameters. In one case, the planet is abducted from a closer orbit in the free disk. In the other case, the planet is placed in a circular orbit. We include the effect of a planet receiving material from the disk in both cases. For the first case, the planet's orbit is initially aligned with the disk and the disk has a constant eccentricity. The planet's orbit can be slightly misaligned by a specified amount. The disk's eccentricity can then be varied by the planet's orbit. We also calculate the heat transfer from the planet to the disk under various assumptions for the planet's orbit, the disk's mass, and the disk's initial condition. We find that the disk's mass and initial condition are not always sufficient to determine the disk's initial condition. If the disk's eccentricity is small, the disk mass can increase the disk's lifetime if it is rotated slowly. We then perform a range of pair-integrals to investigate the effects of the planet receiving material. We find that if the planet's orbit is initially misaligned, the disk's mass can increase the disk's lifetime to at least 1 Myr (at least 1 Myr if it rotates slowly). This leads to a variety of observable effects, including a reduction in the disk lifetime as the planet orbits its host star.\nWe present the first results from a radial velocity survey for planetary candidates around evolved intermediate-mass stars.

The heating of the atmosphere by the star is therefore important for the flow velocity in the form of a large difference between the equatorial and radial areas of the atmosphere. The radial extent of the heating or its direction is determined by the interaction of the stellar wind with the planetary corona.

Jupiter has a short time sensitivity, and its amplitude is relatively constant with time. It is even more sensitive to stellar radioactivity than the solar wind. The Jovian atmosphere is also considerably distorted by the presence of clouds and aerosols. We also find that the transits of Jovian radioactivity and magnetic fields do not always occur the first or second seen by the observer. The rapid rotation of the planet places significant limits on the timing of the radioactivity. The Jovian atmosphere is also very sensitive to solar wind density and velocity, which can produce significant radioactivity. The radioactivity of Jovian and solar wind particles has been simulated by means of an analytic model.

The net outgoing energy flux, which is estimated from the solar wind remaining velocity, is equal to 1.2 times that in the 14 days orbit.

The temperature distribution and the mass function of the atmosphere are also investigated.\nContext. The recent detection of the first extrasolar planet raises the question of how common or rare such planets are. Aims: We present a study on the frequency of extrasolar planets based on radial velocity (RV) data. We analyze the distribution of planets in the frequency range 0.05 about \u2113 \u2264 1.7, yielding a distribution of planets with a mean distance from a star of 0.15 \u00b1 0.02 kpc and a mean eccentricity of 0.07 \u00b1 0.04. We also compare our results with the results of a recently published survey of about 1000 stars for extrasolar planets. Methods: We use the HARPS and Keck radial velocity (RV) spectrographs to obtain an absolute precision of about 3 m s-1 over a time baseline of 80 h, while accounting for the transit of the planet around the primary star. We recalibrate Kepler parameters, including the planet's orbital inclination and eccentricity, through a Markov chain Monte Carlo analysis. Results: We find a frequency of 1.7 about \u2113 \u2264 2.0% for planets in the 0.05 about \u2113 \u2264 1.7, and 1.7 about \u2113 \u2264 3.3% for planets in the 1.5 about \u2113 \u2264 2.6, and 3.8 about \u2113 \u2264 4.1% intervals, respectively. Conclusions: Our results confirm previous findings that extrasolar planets with orbital periods larger than 20 days have a frequency similar to that of solar-type planets. This finding is in agreement with the data from other surveys. We confirm that the planets of the 0.05 about \u2113 \u2264 1.7, 1.7 about \u2113 \u2264 2.6, and 3.8 about \u2113 \u2264 4.1% intervals are transiting.

Follow-up observations yielded no additional planetary signals. Here we analyze the multi-epoch photometric, radial velocity, and spectral observations of the star with the purpose of confirming and characterizing the candidate. We find that the spectral features of the companion are consistent with that expected from a brown dwarf companion with an orbital period of 9.7 \u00b1 0.2 d. We also find that the period measured in the photometric light curve can be more accurately represented as 347 \u00b1 2 d. We conclude that the companion is not a planet, as the available data rule out the possibility that the radial velocity variations are due to the presence of a planetary companion with a period of 9.7 \u00b1 0.2 d.Based on observations obtained at the 2-m Alfred Jensch Echelle Spectrograph (Jensch Echelle Spectrograph, Jensch-University GmbH) and the 6.5-m Herschel Telescope (Herschel, ESA) at the European Southern Observatory (ESO, Chile) and with the Hobby-Ford Telescope (HFT) at McDonald Observatory (University of Texas at Austin) and with the 2.15-m Keck Telescope (California Institute of Technology, University of California).\nThe effect of a planet of a few Jupiter masses on the orbits of close-in planets is studied using numerical integrations.

The initial conditions of interstellar molecules are not well known, and it is not possible to predict which molecules will be stable. Nevertheless, some basic properties of molecular chains are known, and it is useful to make some assumptions.\nThe origin of the ionizing and heating atmospheres of giant and terrestrial exoplanets is the subject of this review. We review the main mechanisms that have been proposed to explain the atmospheres of exoplanets, focusing on the effects of stellar irradiation on the structure and evolution. We also discuss the different observational techniques available to study these atmospheres, and the different choices of analytic models to interpret observations. We finally summarize the main conclusions that have been reached from different observational approaches, and propose future avenues for future research.\nWe present the first results from our secondary eclipse spectroscopic survey of the hot-Neptune GJ3470b. Our observations were obtained with the Magellan/MagE high-precision spectrograph on the 3.6-m United States Naval Observatory (USNO) Astrophysical Observatory (USNO-US) 2.2 m telescope, with focal ratio precision of \u223c0.01 mag at 2300-5000 \u00c5, and spectral resolution of R = 22,000-4000 \u00c5, depending on wavelength, and cover the wavelength range from 0.9-0.9-22 \u03bcm. We report the detection of a subtle but significant secondary eclipse (1.4\u03c3), which is consistent with the presence of a 1.0\u03c3 eclipse, and that extends to both sides of the planet\u2019s orbit. The eclipse depth is \u223c0.012% at 2300-5000 \u00c5, and does not vary with wavelength as expected for a circular orbit.

Our work explores the formation of complex molecules and organic molecules in the interiors of exoplanets by using a full three-dimensional (3D) hydrodynamics code and using the spatial and temporal dependence of the chemical reaction rates. We study the formation of different types of organic molecules and planetary atmospheres and then present two examples of the formation of organic molecules and atmospheres in exoplanets. We then explore the effects that the planetary composition and the chemical reaction rates have on the formation of organic molecules and atmospheres. We find that the planetary composition and the chemical reaction rates can have a strong influence on the formation of organic molecules in the interiors of exoplanets. In particular, the chemical reaction rates have a strong effect on the formation of organic molecules and atmospheres in the form of giant 'snot' and 'turd' particles.

We present a simplified analytic model for the parameterized transit light curves which may be used to fit light curves to the full light curves using our simplified fitting procedure, which takes advantage of the many advantages of Bayesian statistics. The method can be applied to any complex planetary transit light curve, including the stellar limb darkening, the orbital phase curve, and the stellar density profile. We provide a general form for the fitting light curve parameter, and a set of limited cases for which the uncertainties can be represented by simple linear functions.

We present a theory for the formation of chains of molecular molecules in the presence of external temperature variations.\nWe present the first detection of an ionizing electron beam by a high-energy laser. The beam is a spinning vortex beam which is parametrized to produce a local electron cyclotron resonance (LCR) in the electron beam. The excited electron beam is stabilized by the laser induced wave after which the beam can be driven to the electron cyclotron frequency by means of a laser pulse. A series of laser pulses of 0.5 or 1.0 keV are used to produce the resonant electron beam. Our work demonstrates that the electron beam can be used to model the high-energy process at large distances from the electron source which can be caused by magnetic fields or turbulent motion in the medium.\nThe solar system planets and moons are not the only ones with auroral emissions today. We use the NASA Voyager spacecraft orbiters data to measure auroral emissions from Saturn, Uranus and Neptune, as well as the TNOs Cassini and Enceladus. Our measurements show that Saturn and Uranus have extensive auroral emissions, while the TNOs have a weak, but significant auroral emissions. Io has a significant auroral emissions, but is not unique. The solar system planets and moons have a very different auroral emissions, with unprecedented auroral activity.

One of the key properties of the environments in which life may emerge is the ability to transfer water vapor from the lower atmosphere to the upper atmosphere during the earliest stages of planetary habitability. Here we report new observations of water vapor in the upper atmosphere of the planet-hosting planet-hosting star HD 189733. The presence of the planet-hosting star means that the HD 189733b atmosphere contains a low density atmosphere, yet the passage of a Martian atmosphere through the atmosphere of the planet-hosting star is detected. The presence of an atmosphere can affect the properties of the planet and the small surrounding protoplanetary disc. This is particularly true for planets orbiting the star that possess a water ocean or a dry atmosphere. We use a 1D 1D model to measure the evolution of the radius, composition, and cloud properties of the atmosphere during the planet-hosting phase of the star, and we perform retrievals on the detection efficiency of the planetary gravitational lensing signal. We find that the detector sensitivity is higher for a planet orbiting a star with a higher metallicity, thereby resulting in lower accuracy for the 1D 1D models. These results can serve as an example of how to assess the current and potential accuracy of 1D 1D models when using short-cadence (scheduled observations) data of a planet-hosting star, by examining the performance of the model as a function of the stellar metallicity.\nWe present a new method to determine the stellar metallicity ([Fe/H]) for stars with high-precision (\u00b1 0.5 dex) stellar parameters obtained from spectroscopy of high-resolution spectra obtained with the ESPaDOnS spectropolarimeter at the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope.

At low signal-to-noise ratio, the data reveal a single-temperature absorption signature at 1.09 \u03bcm which is significantly attenuated by the composition of the transmission spectrum. The absorption features are well-fitted by models of a fully cloud-free atmosphere with a temperature contrast of T &lt; 1000 K. The atmospheric parameters were derived from a 1D cloud-free atmosphere model. We measured a spectral slope of a few parts per million per unit band (1 ppm) for WASP-19b, which is consistent with previous studies. We also find that the 8-13 \u03bcm water absorption band is well-fitted by a model which includes all the gas absorption lines at the 1-4\u03c3 level. We observed a spectral slope of 1.4 ppm for WASP-19b which is consistent with the previous 1 ppm result for this feature in the ground-based spectrum. We also provide an updated optical transmission spectrum for this planet, which differs from the one previously published by Chen et al.

It is shown that the pressure-induced molecule clustering results in a significant density contrast with the static structure. We also investigate the surface density profiles caused by pressure-induced molecules and the resulting shocks. Then we compute the resulting shock velocities for various scenarios for the absence of the pressure discontinuities. We find that the density contrast with the static structure results in a low velocity dispersion and a conical shape in the shock profile. The vertical profile shows that the pressure-induced molecules have a strong influence on the shape and speed of the shock.\nWe have performed numerical simulations of the accretion of icy particles in a protostellar nebula with three different initial conditions: an isotropic disk with equal gas and dust grains, a dust-rich disk with equal gas and dust grains, and the presence of dust grains with sizes similar to those of the largest grains. In all cases, the gas-grain accretion rate is consistent with the critical value set by Rayleigh scattering. This behavior is consistent with the predictions of several model atmospheres for protostars. We have found that the gas accretion rate is highly sensitive to the initial radial distribution of gas and dust in the disk, and that the radial distribution of gas and dust is not a free parameter. In the center of the disk, where the gas mass is similar to the mass of the largest grains, the gas accretion rate is of the order of the critical value set by Rayleigh scattering. However, the radial distribution of gas and dust is not a free parameter.

The reactant atoms are transported from an ice inversion layer to the top of the ice sublimation layer, where they are ground into ice precursors, transported to the surface, and condensed into ice precursors and water. The best way to understand the initial conditions and the processes which take place in the ice sublimation layer is therefore to understand how water reacts to these reactant molecules.\nWe present and critically review several observational aspects of the atmospheres of transiting extrasolar giant planets (EGPs) and brown dwarfs (BDs). In particular, we focus on the spectroscopic observations of the planetary atmosphere and the identification of the fundamental atmospheric properties of EGPs and BDs. Some of these observations appear to reveal the origin of the temperature-pressure profiles in the atmospheres of EGPs and BDs. These temperature-pressure profiles, in turn, suggest the formation and structure of the atmospheres of these two classes of extrasolar giant planets and BDs.

We identify the spectrum and the line of sight signature of photochemical haze in TWA-2. We find that the main signature of photochemical haze is the emission of the H2O, CO, and CO2 photodissociation bands in the thermal infrared. The line of sight signature is dominated by the absorption of the H2O, CO, and CO2 bands in the NIR. We provide a simple model to fit the observed spectrum of TWA-2 to infer the amount of haze producing the signature in the line of sight.

It is suggested that haze formation in the disk is an important process that can be sensitive to the chemical composition of the disk gas. We attempt to constrain the gas composition of the disk midplane by modeling the disk gas temperature distribution, which is necessary to accurately model the haze formation. We assume that the disk gas is chemically homogeneous and has a C/O ratio that is close to unity. We find that the gas distribution of the dust grains is unassociated with the gas at large distances from the central protoplanet, but is strongly correlated with the gas at small distances. The gas distribution of the gas is also strongly correlated with the photoevaporative flow. The gas distribution of the grain size distribution and its correlation with the gas distribution are consistent with grain growth by evaporation from the disk surface. We infer that the gas temperature distribution in the disk midplane is not slightly inhomogeneous but is highly correlated with the dust temperatures.\nIn this paper, we carry out a general analysis of the spectral features of CO2 in radiative atmospheres using a one-dimensional model (involving the mixing ratio of CO2 and CO in radiative regions) for two cases, namely the photochemical CO2-dominated and chemical-free case. We quantify the effect of the addition of a chemical reservoir for the CO2 partial pressure, which is a parameter that is often neglected due to the presence of a photochemical CO2 atmosphere. We compute the spectral features in the three cases with the same model parameters (i.e. without any chemical imbalances) and the same mixing ratios (i.e. with and without the addition of a chemical reservoir). We find that the chemical-free case is the dominant case in the full atmospheric parameter space. We also study the effect of treatment with a chemical reservoir.

We present modeling of the evolution of the disk mass, dust content, and internal structure of disks around these objects. Methods: We used a simple approach for modeling the evolution of the dust content in protostellar disks. We obtained a list of dust masses and temperatures in the disk, extracted their evolution from a set of reference disks, and compared them with the evolution of a class of stars that are less massive and less evolved than the Sun. We examined the observational constraints on the formation of the disk mass, which are obtained by measuring the radial extent of the disk and its size. We examined the observational constraints on the dust temperature and composition. We considered the effects of the evolution of the disk surface density. We also considered the effects of the evolution of the dust properties and the presence of optically thin emission from the disk wind. Results: We found that the disk mass in protostellar disks is not well constrained. The mass of an optically thin disk is important for determining the size of the disk. The mass of the disk surface density can also be used to constrain the radius of the disk. The evolution of the disk is determined by the total mass of the disk. The evolution of the dust content is constrained by the dust temperature. We found that the disk surface density can be used as a proxy for the surface density of the disk wind.

The first scenario suggests that the planet deposits a large number of small bodies in the outer disk. This is followed by rapid inward drift of the planet after it migrates inward. The second scenario suggests that the migration is very rapid. We found that the planet migrates fast, even without accounting for gas accretion. The migration rates suggested by the two models are not significantly different.\nWe analyze the distribution of planetary orbits in the so-called Kepler data.

We show that this process is unlikely to explain the observed frequency of hot-Jupiter systems. Instead, it is likely that the frequency of hot-Jupiters is correlated with the stellar metallicity, and thus we suggest that a simple model in which the hot-Jupiter transit probability is proportional to the planet mass is the optimal way to explain this correlation.\nWe have conducted a phase curve survey for the M4.5 dwarf GJ 581 with the ARCES echelle spectrograph.

We consider a large number of close binaries with different masses and distances from their parent stars and consider their evolution under the influence of the various initial conditions. For this purpose, we have performed a series of simulations to study the evolution of the disc accretion rates at different distances from the central bodies, and we use these simulations to study the effects of the initial conditions on the final disc mass and semimajor axis distribution. We find that the disc mass decreases with increasing mass ratio in close binaries with initial disc mass ratios down to 0.05, while it increases with increasing distance from the central bodies up to 0.08. On the other hand, when we include the effect of the change in initial disc mass, the mass distribution is essentially unchanged. We also find that the semimajor axis distribution can be quite well reproduced by disc models with mass and distance ratios around that of the initial disc mass. The final semimajor axes are approximately independent of the initial mass. We also find that the change in initial disc mass can lead to a significant increase in the semimajor axis distribution. Finally, we find that the final semimajor axes are correlated with the distance from the central bodies, especially for binaries with initial disc masses m &gt; 0.1 M\u2609 and m &gt; 0.1 M\u2609. The correlation between initial disc mass and semimajor axis is also observed for close binaries whose final semimajor axes are larger than the initial disc mass. In general, the correlation between initial mass and semimajor axis is larger than the correlation between final semimajor axes and initial disc mass.\nWe study the evolution of a planetary system with two giant planets, with mass M and period P, around a solar-like star with a mass of 0.9 M\u2609 and a semimajor axis of 0.032 AU and in a close-in configuration."}, {"Input": "Earth-analogues around nearby stars", "Output": "Earth-analogues around nearby stars.The object spectra are only available at the CDS via anonymous ftp to <A href=\"http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr\">http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr</A> (ftp://130.79.128.5) or via <A href=\"http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/qcat?J/A+A/619/A142\">http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/qcat?J/A+A/619/A142</A>\nWe report the discovery of a new super-Earth-sized planet, KELT-1b, in a 2.50-day, eccentric orbit around a Sun-like star with a mass of 0.19 M\u2609 .

We show that natural events are not always expected to be entirely successful at producing microlensing events, nor are all natural events guaranteed to be 100 per cent efficient at producing the expected microlensing events. We find that natural events can sometimes suffer from serious degeneracies, leading to the unexpected outcomes that are either an incorrect or incomplete description of the event. For the observed events, we find that the degeneracies are largely caused by the existence of a finite source population, which is a population that is not fully described by the lensing event. We then consider the source population that is expected to occur naturally and show that a finite source size can lead to a degeneracy between the event and the source, potentially causing a misidentified event. We find that these degeneracies are likely not due to lensing events.\nWe study the behavior of uncounted lenses in galactic bulge. We investigate the properties of uncounted bulge lenses and f(V) lenses from the special case of a lensing event, which is a lensing between two stars with the same primary mass and which has been detected from observations in the Galactic bulge.

We present a theoretical analysis of the orbital evolution of the Galilean satellites around Jupiter. We consider the dynamical evolution of the satellites as a function of orbital distance from the planet, and find that the Galilean moons can be neatly categorized into two large groups: (i) the Galilean satellites of Jupiter are all within \u223c1 au of the planet, and (ii) the Galilean satellites of Jupiter are in the 2.0-3.0 au range. We find that the Galilean satellites of Jupiter could be dynamically excited to near-circular orbits with periods of a few days, or even as short as a few hours, or may be observed to be drifting in eccentric orbits with periods of a few days. The dynamical situation of the moon-forming regions around Jupiter may be determined through the long-term orbital evolution of the Galilean satellites.\nThe observations of the transiting extrasolar planet XO-4b are reviewed. It was discovered as a candidate planet using precise radial velocity measurements carried out with the HARPS spectrograph at the 3.6 m telescope on the ESO 3.6 m telescope in La Silla, Chile.

In particular, NASA recently announced the discovery of two new exoplanets orbiting the Sun-like star HD 82943 and the planet with a minimum mass of 4.2 MJup orbiting the M3 dwarf HATS-15.

We find that the spin orientation of the planet can be well constrained by its orbit, and that Jupiter's obliquity is likely uncorrelated with its obliquity in the solar system. The obliquity of the orbit can be measured from the rotation velocity of the planet, and vice versa. We find that the obliquity of the orbit can be constrained by the orbital period by combining the obliquity of the orbit with the orbital period. This method can be used to determine obliquity in the future with the next generation of telescopes.\nWe present a comprehensive comprehensive model of the evolution of the protoplanetary disk around the young star Proxima Centauri, based on its spatial and radial properties as a function of time, space, and rotation. Our model includes the formation of the protoplanetary disk in the first place, the evolution of its surface density and temperature, and the growth of dust grains. We consider the disk in its early evolution and its later evolution owing to the orbital evolution of its massive companion Proxima Centauri. Our results indicate that the disk's spatial evolution can be well described by a single power law with index -2.5, where -2.5 is the logarithm of the disk's vertical distance from the central star. Our solar system is a typical case of this disk, with a negative power-law index and a positive logarithm. It is difficult to infer the disk's radial properties from the logarithm.

We detect 32 sources with 1-4 m s-1 velocities above the background that were not seen in previous studies and find that their velocity amplitude is correlated with photospheric metallicity. We find that the velocity amplitude is typically less than 10 m s-1, but increases with metallicity up to [Fe/H] = -0.6. We also find that the velocity amplitude can be well approximated by the Raman model. We combine the velocity amplitude with published photometric data and find that the observational data are well approximated by the Raman model. We find a distribution of photospheric metallicity, with a smooth cutoff at [Fe/H] = -0.7, which is significantly steeper than previous measurements. We find that the peak in the velocity amplitude is concentrated around [Fe/H] = -0.4. We then use these data to study the distribution of photospheric metallicity and metallicity in the Taurus molecular cloud. We find that the mean metallicity in the Taurus cloud is less than 0.1 dex, and that the mean metallicity decreases with decreasing radius up to about 0.6 R\u2609. The mean metallicity decreases with decreasing radius up to about 0.6 R\u2609, and then increases with decreasing radius up to about 0.8 R\u2609.

Geophysical modelling of the solar irradiance and its variation with time has been done through the Sun as an example. Aims: We study the Sun as an active star to better understand solar activity and to provide insight into the corresponding effects of the stellar magnetic activity on the Sun's climate. Methods: We used solar magnetic activity data presented in the solar observations made by the ESA Mobile Applications Solar Astrophysics (XAOSA) and Solar Terrestrial-Earth Science (STERES) missions. We performed a global climate model, which assumes that solar activity is governed by the stellar magnetic field. Results: The total solar irradiance is modulated by the Sun's rotation and stellar rotation periods. A stellar cycle is then modulated by the Sun's orbit and by the stellar rotation. A strong interaction between the stellar magnetic activity and the rotation of the star and of the planet is also considered. We find that the solar activity varies strongly with the rotation period, and that the solar magnetic activity is responsible for the observed variations in the solar irradiance with a period of about 6.2 yr. The solar activity is modulated by the stellar rotation and by the orbital and galactic magnetic fields. Conclusions: The solar activity variations with a quarter of a cycle, which is responsible for the observed variations in the solar irradiance with a period of about 6.2 yr, are found to be responsible for solar variability with a period of about 19 yr.

We apply a general circulation model to study the evolution of the disk with time and take account of the effects of the planetesimal disk. We consider the mass evolution of the disk around the planetesimal, and we find that the evolution is fairly linear. After a while the disk is essentially stopped. The planetesimal is no longer gravitationally interacting with the disk, and it is scattered to the limit of planetesimal survival. The mass evolution is expressed as a power law with a slope of 2.17-0.11+0.09. For small values of planetesimal survival, we find a significant acceleration of the planetesimal disk, and the disk is no longer a flat disk. We therefore conclude that the disk around the planet does not survive, either by absorbding the incoming photons or because of evaporation of the disk by the planet.

We also discuss the prospects of detecting brown dwarfs in transiting circumbinary planetary systems, in the context of current and planned planet-finding missions.\nRecent work has shown that a significant fraction of stars harbour planets with radii less than the Earth's radius. We study this problem by studying the transit detection efficiency for potential planets detected by the Kepler mission. We find that Kepler detects about 2% of planets that are likely rocky and have periods between 100 and 500 days. We then use these results to constrain the radius distribution of planets found by Kepler. We find that the radius distribution functions are different when we account for potential planets with Earth-like and Neptune-like radii. We then apply these results to the radii of known planets and Kepler candidates from the Kepler Input Catalog. We find that the radius distribution of candidates with radii less than twice that of the Earth is not an anomaly. Rather it is a smooth function of the radius, which appears to be a regular result. We then use these results to study several issues of planetary systems found by Kepler. We find that the Kepler size distribution is smooth for all possible initial conditions, but that there are significant differences between radius distributions for planets within 2 R \u2295 and those in the radius range from 1 to 100 R \u2295.

We study the evolutionary and atmospheric dynamics of a planet with a stationary orbit around the Sun and evaluate the HZ for different types of potential host stars. We consider three different potential host stars, which we selected because their stellar properties are very similar to the Sun: GJ 699 C, HD 202666, and HD 212466.

We find that a hot Jupiter is stable under tidal heating if it has a hot core of 10 Earth masses or larger and a slow water loss rate of &lt;1 \u00d710-7 g s-1. It is more stable under intense heat if its core is a significant fraction of the mass of its host star. Finally, we investigate the internal structure of the hot Jupiter Proxima b, which is initially on a near circular orbit around a Sun-like star, and we compare it with the solar system giant planets. We find that Proxima b is stable under tidal heating at the 10 Earth-mass level.\nContext. Stellar activity can cause systematic errors in the determination of planetary parameters.

The new planet, HAT-P-1b, has a radius of 1.03 \u00b1 0.06 RJup, a mass of 0.76 \u00b1 0.05 MJup, and a period of 2.045517 \u00b1 0.000005 days. It orbits the star with a semimajor axis of 0.0754 \u00b1 0.0012 AU and a stellar inclination of 88.3\u00b0. HAT-P-1b is the second closest known M dwarf companion with a mass and period of less than 5 MJup. We do not detect a transit of HAT-P-1b in our MCMC photometric light curves, but we do have the additional benefit of timing observations taken with the Kepler and CoRoT satellites, which provide a direct, single-transit opportunity. We modeled the light curves of the three known planets in the HAT-P-1 system, and we found that the planet-to-star radius ratios, q, are almost independent of each other. However, we found that the planet-to-star mass ratios, q, are significantly higher than expected from the stellar entropy. This is due to the higher entropy being produced by the planet's longer period and consequently causes the planet-to-star radius ratios to be larger. We also find that the orbital inclination, \u03bb, is a poor proxy for the planet's mass. This is due to the large uncertainty in the stellar entropy. The planet-to-star mass ratios, q, and q-parameter itself each exhibit large scatter, and our analysis confirms that the two parameters are not equal for all scenarios. The two-planet model is most consistent with the light curves, and our analysis suggests that the stellar mass ratio is not sufficient to explain the observed planetary orbit.\n"}, {"Input": "We can remotely sense an atmosphere by observing its reflected, transmitted, or emitted light in varying geometries.

This light will contain information on the planetary conditions including the composition of the stellar atmosphere. We present the first results from the analysis of a single transit of WASP-12b with the Cornish Cygnus OB2 telescope. We observed a transit with a depth of 0.041 \u00b1 0.006%, in which the planet-to-star flux ratio is 2.1 \u00b1 0.2%. We then modeled the transit in the light curve with a simple blackbody model that assumes both stellar and planetary properties. We follow the transit light curve with an altitude-dependent parameter of 0.10-0.20+0.20 planetary radii and an inclination angle of 92\u00b0 \u00b1 2\u00b0. We derive an upper limit on the planet mass of 14.5 \u00b1 1.5 M\u2295, which is consistent with previous studies. This is consistent with the mass determined from the transit depth. We then compare the multiwavelength light curve with a depth-dependent model. This allows us to determine the planet's orbit inclination angle. We find that the planet-to-star flux ratio at the time of our observations is 1.0388+0.0016-0.0015, which is consistent with the planetary radius determined from transit observations. We also find that the transit depth is not always linear with height above the planet and is often not directly observable, but can provide information on the planetary albedo. Finally, we combine the multiwavelength light curve with a depth-dependent model to determine the planet's geometric albedo, which is 0.09 \u00b1 0.008 for the transit with the lowest impact parameter. This is consistent with previous results. We also perform a joint fit to the transit light curve with a depth-dependent model. This allows us to determine the planet's geometric albedo, which is 0.03 \u00b1 0.007 for the transit with the highest impact parameter.\nWe study the formation of planets in gas-rich disks around intermediate mass stars in the framework of the theory of gas-poor accretion disks (THAINS).

I show that in order to characterize an atmosphere, it is necessary to measure its transmission, reflected, and emitted light. For earth-like planets, it is necessary to measure the albedo of the atmosphere, which influences the amount of visible and thermal radiation we observe. The albedo is measured either by the planet itself, or by a third party, such as the observer or a ground-based telescope. I also outline how ground-based telescopes can measure the albedo of an atmosphere. Finally, I lay out how ground-based telescopes can be used to observe the albedo of the atmosphere.\nThe surface of planets form their atmospheres from a layer of molten magma at the base of the inner (rocky) mantle. This magma is typically assumed to be a mixture of H 2O and CO 2. This assumption is not always justified because the composition of the mantle depends on the composition of the magma source (the source will be different for different types of planets). However, it is sometimes assumed that the mantle is homogenous, i.e., that it is composed of a mixture of CO 2 and H 2O 2. We show that this assumption is not always justified because different measurements to infer the composition of the mantle require different assumptions regarding the composition of the mantle. We show that the magma is not homogeneous and that it is possible to infer the compositions of a magma ocean planet from the shape of the thermal profile of the thermal profile. The thermal profile of the thermal profile is a function of the planet\u2019s mass and the planet\u2019s orbital distance. For planets with masses as low as 1.5 M \u2295 and orbital distances as large as 10 au, the thermal profile can be determined by fitting the thermal profile to the spectral energy distribution of the planet. If the mass and orbital distance are 1.5 and 10 au, the thermal profile can be determined by fitting the thermal profile to the thermal profile of the planet\u2019s satellite.

This light will contain information on the planetary conditions including clouds, hazes, and aerosols. Because of the great distances and small radii of planets, the optical depth of a planet's reflected light is significantly smaller than its optical width, which is due to the Earth's atmosphere being non-uniform and stable in the presence of different atmospheric constituents. The planetary albedo is a critical parameter to accurately determine because it determines the chemical composition of the planetary atmosphere. Here we present a method using the spectral subtraction technique to obtain critical information on the planetary exospheric parameters for high-angular resolution starlight spectroscopy. We use the planetary spherical harmonic degree of freedom to determine the significant and insignificant planetary orbital effects. We then use a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMCMC) algorithm to determine the best-fitting orbital parameters from spectral fitting to an Earth-like planet, using greenhouse models. Our method can be run on a grid of spectral fitting codes, and the accuracy of the results can be investigated with a Bayesian analysis. We demonstrate that the expected photometric precision of a planet of Earth-like composition can be approximated well by the MCMC MCMC MCMC analysis, with the expected scatter being only a few percent.\nAstrometry is an effective method for the detection of exoplanets. Here, we present simulations of an exoplanet detection algorithm, which is based on the most pessimistic likelihood ratio test to date, the most optimistic likelihood ratio test to date, and a conventional Monte Carlo statistical test.

We will model the light curves of the Sun, Earth, and Mars with the same precision as the Hubble Space Telescope for the three most common light sources (photometric, spectroscopic, and radio) and then use a Monte Carlo model to estimate the uncertainty in the measured parameters. The method relies on the assumption that the uncertainty in the measured parameters is uncorrelated with the choice of the input model. We demonstrate that the method produces accurate results when the planetary parameters are well constrained by the available data. We compare our results to those obtained by other methods, and provide guidance for the use of the method when compared to other methods.\nWe present a new method to determine the stellar radius of an OGLE target which consists of integrating a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of the stellar spectra over the extended wavelength range from 0.2 to 2.7 microns. We demonstrate that the stellar radius determined using this method is in most cases more accurate than the radius of the stellar disk, i.e. the stellar radius is always less than the disk radius, even when the stellar radius is determined from the stellar disk radius. This is due to the large spread of stellar radii in the stellar disk. Moreover, the stellar radius determined using this method is almost independent of the stellar mass, which is the case expected from SMA. This method may be of use to the community to derive stellar radii for OGLE targets.\nWe present a new method for the determination of the stellar radial velocity (RV) from the photometric light curve of an exoplanet, which may be useful for the large exoplanet surveys that aim to detect extrasolar planets by measuring the RV of the host star.

The current survey is sensitive to debris disk masses of about 0.2 M\u2609, for which the upper limits are about 1 M\u2609. The point spread function (PSF) is also sensitive to dust properties, with an upper limit of about 1 \u00d7 10-8 of the total flux of the disk in the visible obtained over the course of the survey. In order to obtain additional upper limits, additional data are needed for about 15 percent of the sample.

The discovery of a planet orbiting a star is an exciting prospect that offers many exciting prospects for the future. In this work we analyzed the stellar magnetic activity of the Sun-like star Proxima Centauri. We selected a sample of 87 individual times of maximum solar activity (peak to date) in the light curve of the star with the lowest rotation period, P, of 1574 \u00b1 0.1 d. We find that Proxima's activity is mainly related to the rotation periods. The apparent stopping time of the activity variations is slow and the mean free path of the stellar magnetic field is about 1.5 kG (gsim100 m). We derive a linear relation between the time of maximum solar activity and the total magnetic energy available in the system: \u0394 E(t/t0) with t0 = (1.66 \u00b1 0.06) \u00d7 10-4 erg cm-2 and \u03b3(t/t0) with t0 = (0.14 \u00b1 0.01) \u00d7 10-4 erg cm-2.

These stars, which are restricted to the solar neighborhood, are expected to be the most massive stars known to date.

The sunspot number count is calculated from U.S. Naval Observatory (USNO) data using a new method that incorporates the effect of solar activity variations. The method accounts for the effects of the Sun's activity, changes in the disc evolution, and magnetic activity. It also accounts for the effects of the Earth's orbital obliquity, magnetic activity, magnetic activity, and the Earth's climate. The number of sunspots per individual sunspot group is also calculated. The sunspot group in the USNO/UMass Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (UMIN) satellite group shows a stronger maximum in the number of sunspots per group than the sunspot group in the USNO/NREL Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (UMIN). The USNO/UMIN solar data group has a maximum sunspot number of 7.6 million, compared with the 2.4 million sunspots per group in the USNO/NREL Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (UMIN).

Previously, the most accurate determinations of the surface temperature profile were obtained by measurements of the reflection spectrum from the atmosphere of Venus. Here, we show that the surface temperature can be measured by ground-based observations to a precision of about 10 cm-2. The key difference between this method and the method of Wojtyl &amp; Lin is that the latter is a reflection spectrum, while the former is a radiative-convective spectrum. We also show that the surface temperature can be determined from a single transit of the planet. We also show that the atmospheric composition can be determined to a precision of about 10 ppm using a single transit of a planet with an Earth-like atmosphere. With the use of this method, the surface pressure can be determined for a number of planets in a given transit, depending on the planetary orbital parameters, including the orbital inclination. The surface pressure can be measured from a single transit of a planet with an Earth-like atmosphere, the whole atmosphere can be spatially resolved, and the spectral pattern can be used to identify features in the transit light curve that are not visible in the spectrum.\nWe used the HARPS high-resolution spectrograph to measure the radial velocity (RV) of HR8799 and its two planets.

In this study, we consider the hydrodynamic effects of hydrated water on the interiors of the Earth's interior that could be preserved in super-Earth conditions and then compare them to the end states of hydrated water on Earth. We determine the elastic properties of the water using a new aplastic method that incorporates the contributions from the two elastic components of the standard body problem (which are determined by the heat transfer by liquid water). We find that the water of Earth is highly elastic, with a strong thermal inertia and a relatively low precession rate. The hydrated water is found to be stable to compression of a variety of compressions, although significantly more water is compressed than is found in the Earth's oceans. We discuss the mechanisms by which hydrated water could be retained for extended periods of time. In some cases, it may be retained for extended periods of time because of its high elasticity. This may be true for the Earth's oceans if the hydrated water is found to be trapped in the deep ocean because of the high pressure of the ocean's lithosphere. We also find that the elastic properties of the water could be preserved for extended periods of time because of the high thermal inertia. We conclude that hydrated water is the only hydrated water that can be preserved for extended periods of time on Earth.\nWe present a comprehensive description of this paper, which is a response to the question whether the principal problems of terrestrial climate are similar to those of the Moon.

We assume that the disk is locally isothermal, and that the cooling rate is governed by the disk's thermodynamic structure.

We find that the GIs are not stable, and that the embryos reach their final locations depending on their internal structure, composition, and disk thickness.

In this paper, we use a previously developed photometric technique to measure the photometric metallicity of the host star of the transiting exoplanet HAT-P-23b. We also report photometric observations of the planet-to-star flux ratio, which has several other properties that are important for determining the planetary radius. We use the photometric data of HAT-P-23b with the HARPS spectrograph to measure the photometric metallicity of the star with a precision of \u03c3 = 0.36 \u00b1 0.03 dex (P/\u03b4 = 0.015 \u00b1 0.003 dex).

We find that the MOST data can be used to study the mean field properties (mean field width, magnitude, extent and strength of the azimuthal field, and its strength and extent from the LMS) but that information of the azimuthal field can be extracted from the EY Dra data rather than the MOST data. This is because the EY Dra wave catalogue is better suited to studying the azimuthal field.

RVs are obtained for each individual target with a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of about 10-5 or better. The RVs are then combined together to produce a single time series of the target parameters.

The gas abundances in extrasolar giant planets (EGPs) are directly related to the chemistry of their planetary atmospheres. However, the chemical composition and abundances of atoms and molecular species present in these atmospheres are still poorly constrained because of a high correlation between the molecular abundances and the abundances of condensible gases present in the atmosphere. Aims: The aim of this work is to derive new abundances of individual condensible elements and condensible gases in the atmosphere of the EGP HD 82943b and to compare them to those in the observed exoplanet atmosphere. Methods: We used a new inversion technique, based on a least-squares fitting procedure, to derive new abundances of four condensible gases: TiO, VO, H2O, and CO2, in a 1D model atmosphere. Results: We detect an inverse correlation between the abundances of the condensible gases and their chemical compositions. The abundances of TiO, VO, H2O, and CO2 are in general significantly lower than those of the observed exoplanet atmosphere, while the abundances of the condensible gases are strongly correlated with the abundances of the condensible gases. Conclusions: We conclude that the chemical compositions and chemical abundances of the EGPs at high altitude are affected by their primary atmospheric constituents, namely, the stellar radiation flux and the stellar parameters. We conclude that the abundances of the condensible gases are sensitive to the chemistry of the atmospheres and may thus be used to constrain the composition and properties of the atmosphere.\nSignificant variations in the transit light curves of extrasolar planets can be interpreted as being induced by a perturbing planet.

We show that if planetary systems are formed in a disk that has been tidally truncated by a planet, then the truncation produces a population of planets with uniformly eccentricities and inclinations over the disk. This stability implies that the observed planets should be substantially larger than the nominal measurements imply. We derive a few analytic results on the expected mass ratios and orbital separations of planets formed in such a disk.

The network is a probabilistically coupled multi-space integration scheme that can be used to model exoplanet atmospheres. The network is constructed using a grid of 3D hydrodynamics, with the 3D parameterized as a function of the planet's thermal structure and internal composition. We demonstrate that the 3D stratification can be used to provide a robust upper limit, beyond which the stratified stratification does not affect the results of 3D Monte Carlo simulations. We extend our analysis to include the 3D stratification in the 3D-BV plane, and discuss the implications of this stratification on the 2D transmission and thermal emission spectra of Uranus and Neptune.\nThe Direct Imaging Spectrometer for Infrared (IR) on board the Spitzer Space Telescope provides time-series spectra of planet-hosting stars, including stellar variability. We describe a new method for extracting radial velocities from such spectra, which involves decomposition of the signal from the photometric calibration of a spectrometer-based instrument (e.g., IRDIS) into components from a photometric-photometric calibration (e.g., FIES, NIRSPEC). The photometric calibration can be obtained using a simultaneous fit to the radial velocity and the spectrometric data to accurately remove any residual starlight. This allows for extraction of photometric data with a precision that is limited by the accuracy of the spatial calibration of the spectrometer-based instrument (e.g.,"}, {"Input": "Exoplanet atmospheric models capable of interpreting the upcoming observations are often limited by insufficiencies in the laboratory and theoretical data that", "Output": "Exoplanet atmospheric models capable of interpreting the upcoming observations are often limited by insufficiencies in the laboratory and theoretical data that could limit their success.

Water ice is a valuable mineral for the study of the SN, particularly at low latitudes, but the abundance of its transition region, P, varies with latitude over the solar system. We find that P can be measured by the Global Positioning System (GPS) satellite using an open-source data product, GOLF-IP, that contains the GPS latitudes and positions relative to the Sun as well as the position and magnitude of the NIRI (Guardian Orbit Interferometer) and SOHO (South Pole Observing Station) instruments. GOLF-IP will provide P>0.15 M \u2295 (\u00b10.05 M \u2295) for the northern hemisphere and P>0.25 M \u2295 (\u00b10.05 M \u2295) for the southern hemisphere, and the NIRI data will provide P&lt;2.5% for the northern hemisphere. We have also used the SOHO spectrometer to survey the P-zone and P-zone boundaries in the SN. We find that both the NIRI and SOHO measurements are consistent with the P-zone boundary being established by water ice. We present the first time-dependent water ice abundance model that accounts for the thermal history of the SN and finds that the P-zone water ice abundance is increasing with latitude.

In this work, we propose a new method to determine the insufficiencies in the astrometric precision caused by imperfections in a sky light curve. We use the most recent model atmospheres to determine the astrometric precision, and we use a Monte Carlo method to estimate the errors in the light curve. In addition, we calculate the expected light curve errors that should be present in a photometric survey of a single planet around a Sun-like star. We use this method to estimate the expected planet-to-star mass ratios, and we show that the confirmed transiting planets with a precision of up to 10-3 should be detectable with current instruments.\nThe near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy of exoplanets is an effective method for probing the atmospheres of planets in their habitable zones (HZs). However, there are several planets orbiting nearby stars whose spectra are too well-constrained by their host stars. In this work, we investigate whether the near-IR spectroscopy of HD 189733b and HD 209458b can be used to constrain their atmospheric compositions and thus obtain improved constraints on their HZs. We simulate the spectral energy distribution (SED) of HD 189733b and HD 209458b with and without clouds and find that the SED of HD 189733b has a \u0394V=6.1+/-0.1 mag \u00b11.5% in the optical, which is smaller than the expected photon noise of about 10-5. We use the SED of HD 189733b as a synoptic reference and compare the SED of HD 209458b to this reference in the SED of HD 189733.

We explore a new approach to the problem of climate model dependence of the radiative forcing of the planet atmosphere with the spectral heating and cooling performed by the planet atmosphere. The method is to use the temperature-pressure profiles of the planetary atmosphere in the presence of a planet-to-star flux ratio that depends on the planet's surface radiation. We find that this approach allows consistent results for different stellar spectral types, planetary orbital distances, planetary energy budgets, and stellar ages.\nWe examine the properties of the Kepler-36 exoplanetary system, which is already known to harbor two planets. We combine these results with recent radial velocity (RV) observations, transit light curves, and Kepler photometry to examine the orbital characteristics of the system. Despite the large mass ratio (q = 1.42 \u00d7 10-3), the system has a rather tight (a = 0.37 AU) orbit. Kepler-36 b has an orbital period of 7.616 days and a minimum mass of 0.732 M\u2295. We calculate the gravity-darkened planetary radius using Spitzer data and find that it is consistent with the value from Spitzer. However, the disk thermal emission spectrum is not well fit by a blackbody, and we find that the disk emission spectrum is best described by a simple power-law. We then perform a detailed dynamical analysis of the system, which includes the presence of free and forced oscillations. We find that the orbital architecture of the system is highly nonlinear, with two nonlinear regimes: the Keplerian and Gaussian modes. The Keplerian mode preserves tightness, but the Gaussian mode can be significantly damped. We also find that the free-fall time of the free oscillations is well constrained by the Keplerian mode, and we find no evidence for a free-fall time consistent with the Keplerian mode. Finally, we find that the orbital inclination is well constrained by the Keplerian mode alone, but we cannot distinguish between the free-fall time and inclination. We therefore conclude"}, {"Input": "Exoplanet atmospheric models capable of interpreting the upcoming observations are often limited by insufficiencies in the laboratory and theoretical data that", "Output": "Exoplanet atmospheric models capable of interpreting the upcoming observations are often limited by insufficiencies in the laboratory and theoretical data that are not available in the laboratory.

In this work, we investigate how the performance of the planet retrieval code Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics (MESA). We consider three different approach to the retrieval problem, which are: 1) Monte Carlo, 2) Bayesian approximation, and 3) Blending method. We find that the former two approaches can be easily computed with the same accuracy, while the Blending method is computationally expensive for all values of the parameter. For a given study, the former is computationally computationally expensive for all values of the parameter. We simply simulate the retrieval problem using the code and compare our results to observational data. Assuming a Newtonian distribution, we find that the retrieval accuracy decreases as the number of parameters depends on the number of parameters and the assumptions used. The retrieval accuracy is only marginally affected by the choice of the parameters. We find that the performance of MESA can be improved by using the access to high precision radial velocity (RV) data to set up the retrieval problem.\nWe present the first results of a multi-analytic study of a very low mass star (VLMS) system: HP-SC2285-00873, which contains a very low-mass companion (VLM) using precise radial velocity (RV) measurements of the star. Our main objective is to determine the mass of the companion, the mass of the VLM, and the system age. In this work we consider both the system architecture and the mass of the companion, and we also consider the mass of the VLM. We find that the VLM is not detected in the RVs. We use a time-series of RVs obtained with the HARPS spectrograph mounted on the 3.6-m ESO telescope to study the radial velocity of the star. We find that the RVs are consistent with the presence of a photometrically detected companion"}, {"Input": "Photochemical organic aerosols are ubiquitous in the cold outer Solar System where", "Output": "Photochemical organic aerosols are ubiquitous in the cold outer Solar System where they provide an important source of heat for the terrestrial and icy planets.

We have used the newly added spectral domains to determine the CH4 and CO2 abundances and the relative abundance ratios in the atmosphere. We find that the high-altitude aerosols in HD 189733b are strongly correlated with each other, with a strong enhancement of CH4 and CO2 near 20 mbar (corresponding to a subtraction of 19.2 % and 24.7 % from the measured CO2 abundance ratios for HD 189733b, respectively). The light curves were modeled using the same radiative transfer code that has been applied previously to similar hot Jupiters. The model results indicate that the satellite light curve can be fit by either an aerosol layer with a temperature of approximately 1400 K and a relative humidity of 0.01, or by a flat region with a temperature approximately 1000 K above the satellite surface.

A new spectral method for the determination of the neutral and ion abundances of hot, extremely hot gas-phase molecules has recently emerged.

The geophysiologist William Blackman traced the instability from the early 19th to the late 19th century. One of Blackman's main objectives was to determine the rate of unstable atmospheric escape, which was difficult because of the long duration of the volcanic outbursts. However, Blackman also observed the cyclical nature of the outbursts, which gave rise to a variety of observational constraints, including the dependence of the outbursts on the longitude of the ascending node.
